<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability found in web applications that allows code (typically JavaScript) to be injected by attackers into web pages viewed by other users. The impact of XSS depends on the circumstances surrounding the vulnerability but can include cookie theft and page manipulation. In the former case, the attacker can masquerade as the victim user by making use of stolen session cookies; in the latter case, the attacker can perform a phishing attack, enticing the victim user to enter confidential information.&nbsp;The following scenario breaks down how a XSS attack could work:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Alice has an account with a website hosted by Bob.</li>
    <li>Eve observes that Bob's website contains a reflected XSS vulnerability.</li>
    <li>Eve crafts a URL to exploit the vulnerability and sends an email to Alice amongst many others. The email, spoofed to look like it originates from Bob,&nbsp;uses social engineering to persuade Alice to click on the link.</li>
    <li>Alice clicks the link while logged in to Bob's website. (If Alice wasn't logged in at the time, Bob's website would likely redirect Alice to a login page and, following successful authentication, Alice would likely be returned to the vulnerable URL.)</li>
    <li>Eve's malicious script embedded in the link is returned in the response from Bob's website and executes in Alice's browser, as if it had originated from Bob. The script sends Alice's session cookie to Eve, who uses it to access Alice's account. Eve can view Alice's data and perform any action for which Alice has authorisation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The above example illustrates non-persistent (or reflected) cross-site scripting when the malicious script within the request is immediately&nbsp;reflected back in the response. Note that only users clicking malicious links will be affected.

<p><strong>XSS found within the Paragon application</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>i2 application</strong>&nbsp;(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span><span><a href="http://vpadti2p.usfdc.corpintra.net:33001/i2/login.jsp" target="_blank">http://vpadti2p.usfdc.corpintra.net:33001/i2/</a>)</span></span></span>&nbsp;is vulnerable to reflective XSS attacks. Following are details of the vulnerable pages and parameters that allow XSS&nbsp;to occur. It is possible that other pages are also vulnerable and any page that returns data originating from end-users should be reviewed in the light of the recommendations given in the main body of the report.</p>
